##  Integrate Stablecoin Explorer into Your Wallet or App

[Stablecoin Explorer](https://stable.range.org/) is the unified block explorer for all USD-pegged stablecoins.  
It tracks USDC, USDT, FRAX, EURe, and 20+ more across 100+ chains and 21 bridges, plus intra-chain activity on Ethereum, Solana, BNB, Noble, and Stellar.

## Why Link to Stablecoin Explorer?

Today, most apps link users to chain-specific explorers like Etherscan or SolScan. That works for single-chain transfers, but it breaks down for cross-chain activity.
**Example: USDC from Ethereum → Solana**
- Etherscan shows the burn on Ethereum
- SolScan shows the mint on Solana
- Neither shows the full lifecycle of the transfer
Stablecoin Explorer fixes this by showing the entire transaction path in one place.

## Comparison

| **Current Workflow** | **With Stablecoin Explorer** |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Users must check two explorers for cross-chain transfers (e.g., Etherscan + SolScan). | One unified link shows all transaction legs (origin, bridge, destination). |
| Apps dynamically generate chain-specific explorer links. | Apps link to a single explorer for all stablecoins, across 100+ chains. |
| Users see raw hashes with little context. | Transactions enriched with verified entities, official addresses, and blacklist checks. |
| Compliance checks require multiple data sources. | OFAC, EU, UK, UN, and other sanctions lists integrated directly in the explorer. |

## Benefits for Wallets & Apps

- **One explorer to rule them all** - Link every stablecoin transfer (cross-chain or intra-chain) in a single place.  
- **Improved user trust** – Users see exactly where funds moved, without confusion.  
- **Co-branded transaction pages** – Add your logo/design to transaction detail pages (no cost).  
- **Referral attribution** – Top referring apps are featured weekly on the Stablecoin Explorer homepage.  
- **Zero integration lift** – Just link with the tx hash or wallet address.  

## How to Integrate

Link to Stablecoin Explorer with the transaction hash or wallet address:
```bash
https://stable.range.org/tx/<transaction_hash>
https://stable.range.org/address/<wallet_address>
````
**Examples:**
