# Risk API

The **Risk API** delivers comprehensive risk assessments for blockchain addresses, tokens, smart contracts, and transactions. It is designed to help you detect suspicious activity, evaluate compliance risks, and protect your users and infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Wallet & Address Risk Scoring:** Evaluate addresses for risk based on behavioral patterns, sanctions lists, and known threats.
- **Transaction Risk Scoring:** Assess the risk of entire transaction flows, combining compliance and behavioral analytics.
- **Token & Smart Contract Risk:** Screen Solana tokens and smart contracts for vulnerabilities, risk factors, and suspicious attributes.
- **Sanctions & Blacklist Checks:** Instantly check addresses against global sanctions and blacklist lists across multiple blockchains.
- **Machine Learning Hooks:** (Optional/experimental) Integrate ML-based risk models for advanced detection.

## Use Cases

- **Compliance & AML:** Screen addresses and transactions for sanctions, blacklists, and high-risk behavior to meet regulatory requirements.
- **DeFi & DApp Security:** Evaluate tokens and smart contracts before integration or user interaction.
- **Network Monitoring:** Track risk trends and suspicious flows across blockchain networks.
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Power dashboards and analytics tools with real-time risk data.
