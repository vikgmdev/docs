## What is Faraday?

Faraday makes using stablecoins safe, simple, and compliant across chains. It combines best-execution swaps, real-time risk assessment, compliance screening, and transaction reporting into a single unified product.

Whether you’re a protocol, DAO, business, or individual, Faraday ensures that every stablecoin transaction is executed efficiently and transparently with the same compliance and risk management assurance expected in traditional finance.

## Who is Faraday designed for?

Faraday is designed for anyone moving stablecoins at scale or under compliance requirements, including:

* Protocols and DAOs managing multi-chain treasuries.
* Fintechs and payment platforms executing user-initiated transfers.
* Funds and trading desks that require risk-aware execution.
* Enterprises and regulated entities needing Travel Rule compliance.

In short, if you handle stablecoins and care about price, compliance, and safety, Faraday is built for you.

## How much does Faraday cost?

Faraday charges no additional execution fees beyond those already included in network gas or aggregator quotes.

Access to Faraday’s API and reporting features is based on a credit system. Each API call consumes credits, with a free tier offering a limited number of requests for developers to experiment and integrate.

For higher-volume usage, tiered plans are available offering additional credits, advanced analytics, audit integrations, and dedicated support for institutional and enterprise users.

## How does Range's Risk Management work?

Range’s Risk Management models continuously monitor blockchain addresses, counterparties, and venues for sanctions, exposure, and behavioral risk.

Before any transaction is executed, Faraday leverages these models to generate a pre-trade risk report identifying potential links to OFAC-listed entities, high-risk wallets, or malicious patterns.

This ensures that every transaction passing through Faraday is screened, rated, and recorded, giving users and institutions confidence in each transfer.

## What is Faraday's relationship with Range?

The Faraday team is part of Range! This allows Faraday to take full advance of Range's deep expertise in Analytics, Security and Risk Management.
