Faraday enables users to seamlessly transfer stablecoins across chains and denominations. Users can move USDT on Solana to USDC on another network in a single API call.

Faraday bundles together:

* Routing
* Intelligence
* Compliance
* Real-time data

The API is tightly integrated with a suite of tools for regulatory compliance, including Travel Rule support, OFAC screening, and an orchestration layer that manages transactions, blocks sanctioned/malicious addresses, and facilitates detailed recordkeeping.

Faraday also connects directly with Range’s monitoring stack, allowing users to set up custom alerts, monitor specific wallets, and track in-flight transactions for risk or anomaly detection.
