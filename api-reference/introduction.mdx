Welcome to the API Reference. This section is your hub for building with Range.

## What you'll find

- [Risk API](../risk-api/risk-introduction) — Risk scoring and insights for addresses, tokens, smart contracts, and transactions.
- [Faraday API](../faraday-api-docs/faraday-introduction) — Programmatic stablecoin transfers with routing, compliance, and fraud controls.
- [Data API](../data-api/data-introduction) — On-chain data: balances, payments, network activity, protocols, and stablecoin analytics.
- [Integrations](../integrations/explorer-network-integrations) — Network- and explorer-specific notes for smoother onboarding.
- Reference — [Quickstart](../reference/quickstart), [Glossary](../reference/glossary), and [Changelog](../reference/changelog).

## Get started quickly

- Generate an API key at https://app.range.org (APIs page). It takes ~30 seconds.
- Add the header: `X-API-KEY: <your-api-key>` to all requests.
- Use the [Quickstart](../reference/quickstart) for a minimal end-to-end example, then dive into each API's introduction page.
