## Prerequisites

To use Faraday, you’ll need a Range API key. If you don’t already have one, follow the [setup guide here](https://docs.range.org/docs/getting-started#/getting-an-api-key).

## Faraday SDK

The [Faraday SDK](https://github.com/rangesecurity/faraday-sdk) provides a fully featured client for the Faraday API, making it simple to authenticate, build, and send requests.

* Install the SDK and start integrating in minutes.
* Written in TypeScript, compatible with both Node.js and browser environments.
* Actively maintained and versioned alongside the Faraday API.

> 📘 Info
>
> Visit the [faraday-examples repository][2] on GitHub to see ready-to-run integration examples using the Faraday SDK.

## Rest API

The [Faraday REST API][3] gives you maximum control and flexibility over how you integrate. Faraday also offers [a Swagger definition][4]. 

* Use the [OpenAPI specification][1] to generate a client in your preferred language.
* Supports the same endpoints and features as the SDK.
* Ideal for teams building custom integrations or non-JavaScript environments.

> ⚠️ Important
>
> It’s strongly recommended to **start in a test environment** and verify your integration before using real funds.
