Faraday uses [IMVS101](https://www.intervasp.org/) Person records to support compliant record keeping for sender and beneficiary on transactions. The [IMVS101 specification](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/648841abc97f28489cc3f2ce/6656e9c60c3029989dcd7431_IVMS101.2023%20interVASP%20data%20model%20standard%20.pdf) is fully implemented by Faraday.

If `travel_rule` is set to true on reqests, Faraday will check that records exist for sender and beneficiary.
