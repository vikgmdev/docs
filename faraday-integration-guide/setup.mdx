This guide helps you set up a test environment using the Faraday SDK to send transactions on:

* **Solana Devnet**
* **Ethereum Sepolia**

## Examples repository

We offer a prepared set of examples that you can clone and run to understand how Faraday works and how you can integrate.

### 1. Clone the Examples Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rangesecurity/faraday-examples
```

### 2. Change into the faraday-examples directory

```
cd faraday-examples
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### 4. Copy the example .env file into place

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Range API key. If you haven't got one yet here follow [the instructions here](https://docs.range.org/docs/getting-started#/getting-an-api-key).

### 5. Generate test keys for the examples

This script creates new Ethereum and Solana keypairs for Alice and Bob, saves them in ./keys, and prints their public addresses.
These keys are only for local testing and should not be used on mainnet.

```shell
npm run dev:setup
```

### 6. Get Faucet Funds

#### Ethereum Sepolia ETH and USDC

* Visit the [Google Cloud Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia)
* Paste **Alice’s Ethereum address** and request Sepolia ETH
* Head to the [Circle Faucet ](https://faucet.circle.com/)
* Request **Sepolia USDC**

#### Solana Devnet SOL and USDC

* Visit the [Solana Faucet ](https://faucet.solana.com/)
* Request **Devnet SOL**
* Head to the [Circle Faucet ](https://faucet.circle.com/)
* Request **Devnet USDC**
